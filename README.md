# Grid Highlighter (Java Program)

This is a simple Java program where I generate an NxN grid with random even numbers from 2 to 20.  
After the grid is shown, the user can enter any even number between 2–20 and the program will highlight that number inside the grid using [xx] format.

The output format follows the sample given in the task (row numbers, column numbers, proper spacing).

## How the program works
1. The user enters the size of the grid (N).
2. The program creates an NxN array.
3. Every cell gets a random even number between 2 and 20.
4. The grid is printed in a clean table format.
5. User enters a number to highlight.
6. The program prints the grid again, but highlights only the selected number.
7. Also shows how many times that number appears.

## How to run the code
1. Install Java on your system.
2. Save the file as `GridHighlighter.java`.
3. Open terminal in the same folder.
4. Run:
  `` javac GridHighlighter.java``
6. Then run:
  `` java GridHighlighter``
